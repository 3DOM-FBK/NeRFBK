# NERFBK: A HIGH-QUALITY BENCHMARK FOR NERF-BASED 3D RECONSTRUCTION
Our high-quality dataset evaluates NeRF-based methods for 3D metrology. Researchers can compare methods on textured, textureless, metallic, transparent, and aerial objects to optimize and validate techniques for real-world use, such as in industrial inspections and cultural heritage preservation.
